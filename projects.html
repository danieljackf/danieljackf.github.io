        <h3>AR Rubik's Cube</h3>
        <p>As part of my Team Software Project Module at University College Cork we created an AR Rubik's Cube Webapp.
          This involved creating a 3D model of the Rubik's Cube in Blender and the animations for it.
          Creating a front end using React so the user can interact with our app.
          Creating a backend using Node.js and Express to handle the requests from the front end and serve the 3D model to the user.
          Finally we used Three.js to render the 3D model in the browser and allow the user to interact with it.

        <h3>Fastnet Lighthouse 3Ds Max</h3>
        <p>As part of my Games Modelling Design Module at the University of Limerick I created a 3D model of Fastnet Lighthouse.
          This involved creating a 3D model of the lighthouse, applying textures to it and running fluid simulations to create the water around it.
          I also created a series of animations to show the lighthouse in different lighting conditions.
