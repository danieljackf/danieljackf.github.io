        <h3>AR Rubik's Cube</h3>
        <p>As part of my Team Software Project Module at University College Cork we created an AR Rubik's Cube Webapp.
          This involved creating a 3D model of the Rubik's Cube in Blender and the animations for it.
          We used React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.
          We used Three.js to render the 3D model in the browser and allow the user to interact with it.

        <h3>Fastnet Lighthouse 3Ds Max</h3>
        <p>As part of my Games Modelling Design Module at the University of Limerick I created a 3D model of Fastnet Lighthouse.
          This involved creating a 3D model of the lighthouse, applying textures to it and running fluid simulations to create the water around it.
          I also created a series of animations to show the lighthouse in different lighting conditions.

        <p>
          After my Google account storage ran out I decided it was time to find a better solution for my file storage needs.
          I decided to build my own self hosted alternatives using an old Dell Optiplex.
          I run Syncthing Server to sync my notes between all my devices.
          I use Immich to store and view my photos and videos instead of Google Photos and I use Jellyfin to stream my media files to all my devices.
          I also use it as an automatic backup for all my important files on my desktop and laptop.
          I used a Tailscale reverse proxy to make all these services available on a single domain with SSL.
